# GPT2-NLP
Using Natural Language Processing to Generate New Recipes in Python
We will be finetuning a distilled version of GPT-2 on a smaller-scale dataset comprising recipes. The recipes are split into ingredients and instructions. Can we use GPT-2 to generate instructions from a list of ingredients?

Prerequisites
- Intermediate-level knowledge of Python
- Basic UNIX/Bash skills for launching scripts
- A Google account (if you'd like to launch a finetuning instance on Google Colab)
- Basic knowledge of neural networks and deep learning (knowledge about large-scale models like BERT and GPT-2 will be preferred, but is not necessary)
- Some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) experience will be beneficial
